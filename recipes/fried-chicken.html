    <h2>Bob's County-level Infamous Fried Chicken?</h2>
    <p>Men have died in search of this recipe. It is a recipe so heinous, so evil that no man/woman/child
        has ever survived eating this chicken (they all died of old age). Please, do try at home, and with a 
        side of Chris' World Famous Chicken Salad! (Or don't, up to you).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Angst</li>
        <li>Passion</li>
        <li>Graphene</li>
        <li>Buckminsterfullerine</li>
        <li>A Carbon based life form</li>
        <li>A sense of humour</li>
        <li>Orange juice (Do not use OJ Simpson as substitute)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 15 cups of OJ (you know what I mean).</li>
        <li>Add 100 fl. oz. of Buckminsterfullerine with 31.3 g of angst. (Be careful not to add too much Buckminsterfullerine when mixing with the angst).</li>
        <li>Add, then immediately remove the sense of humour.</li>
        <li>If you have a blow torch, it would be the perfect opportunity to get that insurance money.</li>
        <li>if (house_is_on_fire) { skip_to_step_7(); }</li>
        <li>Commit arson (if so inclined).</li>
        <li>Congrats, you forgot the Chicken so pop by KFC and pick yourself a nice, big, tender, juicy, voluptuous, bucket of chicken.</li>
    </ol>
